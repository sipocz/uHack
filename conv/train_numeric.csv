Essentially what the M-Pact nozzle does is pulsate the water stream and flicks it side to side (think of holding a regular hose nozzle and using your wrists to move it side to side).If you don't own a pressure washer or don't want to invest that kind of money, this is a good alternative to dislodge stuck on grime with minimal effort.As the packaging states, it is not for use on plants. I gave it a try on a weed that was growing in our garden. It will snap your plants and send dirty splattering due to the force of the impact. Overall it's an interesting tool to help get some dirt, grime or other substrates dislodged and removed, however the pulsating and unsteady stream makes it difficult to get a good clean.

One for the back, another for the front, more to replace the wands that got stepped on or left out in freezing weather (freeze damage). Bought more for friends and family. This model is the least leaky of any I've tried over 50 years of watering. Easy operate flow control/shut off. Easy to change, very functional pattern settings. Great for Bonsai, potted plants, spot watering, car washing, planter washing etc.It's great for a short reach and for distancing myself from the splatter of rinsing and washing so many things.I wrote this after searching for another to replace the freeze damaged wand. The damage is my fault. It can be prevented by draining or keeping from freezing. I'm going to buy several because I'm undependable at winter storage.

I double-checked the toilet myself using online advice and couldn't find anything wrong. I replaced all of the flush hardware in the tank. Nothing worked. I called another plumber. He said the jets below the rim of the bowl were clogged and that I should just put in a new toilet. I was a little skeptical since 11 years didn't seem all that old to me. Also the old toilet never worked all that well, and I wondered whether its relatively low 1.6 GPF was the true culprit. This made me concerned about the even lower GPF of the new toilets. But, being out of options, I went ahead and replaced the old toilet with this one. Bottom line is this new toilet is working perfectly.

The rubbery handle makes it easier to grip even when wet. The head also swivels up to 90 degrees either direction for angle usage which is great when watering hanging baskets. Another thing the is also great for watering baskets is that it extends from about 28 inches to 41 inches so if you have to reach up, around or through something you have the extra reach to do just that. It also comes with a built in shut off to start and stop water flow which makes stopping operation much easier then having to run to the faucet to turn it on or off.

In the middle of a nite tinkle!).  For the dual flush one would flush one or the other button but not both -wpuld be awkward. Well when u flush one and your finger goes down with the button there is a gap where ur finger would naturally slide to (button not that big) and gets pinched by the empty gap under the other button.

It is designed to mount in the ground by the ground stake. I had to figure out how to change the direction or direction change. That is controlled by a set of fingers that are clasped around the base and the sprinkler head rotates as it pulses and is turned a different direction when it contacts one side of the fingers. I had to also figure out that in order to make it pulse for a more wide area, I had to flip out the spring on the pulse head out and move the fingers all the way backward. It will then pulse all the way around and then back again. I haven't found a way to make it pulse only like a quarter way, half way, three quarter way and etc. It's not like some I have owned in the past.

I was skeptical of the reviews at first - so many positive and lower priced than a lot of others with a plethora of issues.Unboxing it wasn't any better it looked pretty basic no major components. Actually thought it was probably missing parts! Nope. I was wrong. I hooked this thing up to my hose and it worked like a charm! Plenty of sprinkler settings to choose from which was great!!I was trying to grow grass late in the season and has to move fast. This definitely helped get my lawn across the finish line before the snow fell!The fact that it is simple is a testament to its construction and there is less that can go wrong with it as a result! I can actually give testament to its durability. I have a menagerie of wildlife in my backyard including a herd of deer. Well went out 1 morning to turn on my sprinkler and it wasn't working.

I even tested it on the front where I adjusted the length and width. That's the best part, that it's all fully adjustable! I haven't had any issue with the plastic yellow tabs breaking. First off, it's plastic, so don't leave it out in the weather, it will weaken and become brittle. Second, don't use hulk strength when pressing on them; light movement/strength is required.

These new ones are not as firm but are in the same ball park (they are not low riders when you sit on them). They are not waterproof but dry fairly quickly (note in the description that they recommend you bring these inside when it rains). I'm hoping to get a couple years out of these.

1891,1891,"Product is easy to install, but note, this isn't my first time installing screens. I've done plenty in my days. The main reason I bought this as a kit was to get the tool. Be careful, there are two different heads on the tool, one to cut, one to guide the spline into the groove.Biggest problem was the extremely fragile screen material. While guiding the spline into the groove with the tool, the material that was pintched between the tool and the edge of the groove was easily sliced. This is with hardly any pressure applied as I typically place the spline, then go back with my homemade tool made just for pushing the spline all the way in without rush of ripping the material.I am now purchasing new material (on a roll). This material comes folded in about a 12"" x 12"" bag.Recommendation: be extremely gentle if you use this material. I can only imagine its longevity in full sun or harsher climates.

They are currently on sale for a GREAT price at 33% off!I've purchased several of these sets so far and will purchase several more at this reduced price. I have no idea why they don't put these clamps up by the tool section; you can find them in back, in the pine board aisle. They would be gone in a day or two.  Hmmm...

You can turn the nozzle all the way counterclockwise to turn off the flow of water, or turn it clockwise through the different spray settings, until you find the setting you wish to use.5. I love how far in distance this nozzle can spray at its hardest spray setting. I don't have unwind the hose much. Just a few times so a can turn in the direction I wish to spray, and then I can spray about 25 â€“ 30 feet from where I am standing. That makes it very convenient.6. It also has a wide spray setting that I like to use. It sprays about 8 feet wide in circumference, covering large areas at a time, when spraying plants that are a little closer to you.There wasn't anything I didn't like about this nozzle.

The were about 2 or 2 1/2 percent smaller than that. This may not seem like a big deal to some but I am doing a heavily engineered structure with a detailed nailing schedule. I used another brand so I would comply with the engineering calculations. I later used some of these nails in non-engineered places. I found that I kept seeing little metal flakes around on the floor. I turns out it was the heads of some of the nails.

Whether I am watering our lawn or plants, if I'm interrupted I sometimes drop the nozzle rather than ""place"" it on the ground. Very happy to see how well made it seems and also looks to be very durable. First of all, it connected easily to our hose, no leaks whatsoever. This is controlled solely by the pistol grip. Squeeze it just a little and it is a wide angle spray, give a bit more pressure and as you go, the more concentrated the spray is. Squeeze it All the way in and you have your Jet spray and it is Very powerful. You can control the spray by using the twisting screw on the nozzle and there is also a lock off metal tab that you can use so you don't have squeeze the handle constantly. A rubber protector on the front protects the nozzle. For watering the lawn or plants, I used it at the wider angles but I must say that it did come in handy also for the vehicles and for anything else we needed it for. I like that I get different spray levels by just squeezing and not having to twist the nozzle. Thank you expert gardener for coming up with a very handy multi use nozzle.

2830,2830,"The telescoping wand and watering nozzle is great for all of my hand watering needs. The wand is about 29 inches long and telescopes out to 43 inches.

There are ten patterns on the nozzle so you can get the right type of watering for your plants. These include Full, Cone, Flat, Center, Vertical, Mist, Jet, Shower, Flood, and Angle. I prefer the shower setting for most of my plants, full or jet are good for removing spots on concrete. The head of the nozzle pivots so that you can get the correct angle to reach your target. This might even be good for cleaning gutters, but I haven't tried that yet. The thumb controlled valve allows you to decrease the flow as you need for more delicate plants or objects.My only problem with this wand is that the fitting at the handle where you thread your hose on is made of plastic. I have other wands where the fitting is made of aluminum. I think the aluminum will last longer.

Occasionally a pipe or metal or wood or something for the house.  For bikes, you have to do a lot of twisting off stuck things.  I cannot clamp down the swivel base hard enough to twist anything with any kind of force.  I also think the base mount footings stick out beyond the edge of the rear jaw, so if you're brave enough to mount it that close to the edge of your bench to have a clear shot straight down, you'll still have the points of the 2 cleats in the way.

I'll keep this one though, on an old bench for small objects needing light duty... it still ""like new"" a few years old.Advice to you:  Are you sure you don't want something better?

It does not put out enough water to cover 4000 square feet of lawn but that is because the water pressure at my house is not high enough. It does put out a lot more than the sprinklers i have tried in the past so i will be buying another one also.See more",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,"[7801, 2680, 3172, 7264, 3108, 5191, 7250, 3981, 4465, 8432, 3996, 3478, 3, 5691, 1378, 243, 576, 8739, 872, 8566, 4040, 278, 5553, 3650, 1548, 278, 120, 3996, 3981, 8432, 2407, 7944, 112, 7801, 2145, 4254, 6397, 1163, 5130, 5167, 5188, 8739, 7801, 120, 7659, 5118, 7983, 5083, 7801, 7819, 3981, 236, 3, 8566, 5737, 4132, 4950, 7944, 7801, 2145, 120, 7659, 7944, 112, 8566, 7231, 2220, 1013, 3802, 5167, 1927, 8566, 7801, 8566, 3650, 1548, 3478, 3, 6606, 7944, 5744, 8053, 3097, 3210, 7944, 7801, 8566, 4040, 278, 1351, 7809, 8290, 278, 7801, 3981, 236, 3, 6481, 3174, 3773, 7801, 1548, 3024, 3, 4232, 3072, 7801, 576, 3981, 8685, 2524, 278, 3522, 2524, 7944, 5744, 7801, 7250, 3097, 8133, 5227, 8655, 2301, 1013, 7801, 3650, 7944, 4818, 7944, 297, 4368, 278, 8739, 8566, 4040, 3996, 5908, 5204, 3, 4414, 5083, 3996, 2250, 4994, 5907, 5204, 2524, 8566, 7944, 1702, 7268, 2807, 5083, 4215, 994, 7796, 3981, 626, 7801, 8566, 5737, 448, 4851, 3659, 3981, 4994, 3562, 3996, 2250, 5907, 5204, 3, 4414, 4788, 7786, 7801, 7251, 3706, 3488, 8077, 3773, 7801, 5332, 7062, 3706, 8703, 605, 1008, 297, 5122, 4788]"

Removing the airtight cans was a major hassle, as they were solidly-made USA-manufactured, rather than a modern imported type. I also found very poor insulation around the cans and usually nothing between the can and the roof sheathing, leading to the cans becoming too hot to touch when the afternoon sun reached the roof.One of the installations required the use of the version of this brace with a slightly larger box because of the number of cables it had to handle.

3806,3806,"One of my patio door screen had a rip along the side. I was seriously contemplating replacing the door itself. It was one of my buddies who suggested to try this. And I was not disappointedThe kit had all the tools that you need to replace the mesh. A spline tool for removing the existing spline, roller to install new splines, spline roll long enough for 2 doors, a measuring tape and a utility knife and of course more than enough mesh screen.The process literally took 15 minutes. Of that I think I spent longest in removing the existing screen. The old spline was dried up over the years and started crumbling when I started removing them. Installing the new mesh was very easy. Instructions provided were sufficient for DIY. I would recommend to have someone help you towards the end, just to stretch the mesh , so that the screen remains taut.Only issue I had was with the roller, I think I might have pressed the spline in little too hard while rolling, that I damaged the mesh and cut a tiny portion (few mm long) on one corner. Just a heads up - you don't need to exert too much pressure while installing the spline. If you feel that it is popping out in some parts, you can use a blunt but flatter object , like handle of a dining knife or a fork to push it back in.Over all a great purchase.

3815,3815,"I have a number of small push-out windows with very little clearance between the frame and the blinds, thin frames, and bulging handles. They were looked at by two professional mesh installers, and neither would take the job without replacing the blinds first. They are almost new and expensive, so no go. This product beautifully solved the issue for a tiny fraction of the cost of a professional installation.I am useless when it comes to DIY, and yet found installing the product relatively easy, and the materials sufficiently forgiving. I perused earlier reviews, which provided lots of useful tips. Make sure to look at them as well. But the instructions are sufficiently detailed, and I would have eventually figured things out of my own. Installing my first mesh took 30-40 minutes, the second one under 20. The result looks clean, and by my third install they are looking professional too (tip: measure the strips beforehand rather than cutting them when applied to the frame so as to get everything perfectly square).I should also say that the company has been a pleasure to deal with. My windows are small (20""x20""), so a kit has sufficient mesh and strips for two windows, but only one set of corners. I didn't want to pay an extra $45 just for four plastic corners. I emailed the seller, and got a very fast response with a couple of reasonable options. One of them worked for me, and we were able to get the requisite materials delivered to my place in 48 hours.

3894,3894,"I have gone through way too many garden nozzles and probably read too many articles about the BEST hose nozzle.  This list doesn't appear on any of them but I find it simply the best for myself. I have learned that I don't like wand nozzles (the angle never seems right except for tall tomato plants and they are just heavy), the newly popular firemen nozzles are challenging to use w/the lever that seems great in concept but in execution is just annoying and that few nozzles have a solid, hefty feel (without being too heavy). This is the best of the lot:-Spray adjustment dial is the best.  Easy to adjust to a different pattern but not too loose or too heavy to move. Just feels solid but so smoothly slips to whatever spray pattern you designate-Spray adjustment possibility:  I thought I would love the adjustable spray nozzles where you just turn it up or down but I've since learned that it is not specific enough for the job that I want (w/the exception of the jet spray pattern).  It is impossible to spray your garden vegetables - especially the tender growth during the spring, difficult to fill up the bird bath, etc.  You really need the distinct spray patterns if you're a gardener (or weed picker which I really am).-Trigger:  I purchased this one for this reason alone.  Even though it's not marketed as being for anyone that wants an easier trigger or for those w/arthritis, this nozzle  has the BEST trigger I've ever felt. Easy, smooth and solid. You won't ever have to exert undue pressure to press the trigger or adjust the rotary dial-Love the rubber coating: It's nicer than the all metal ones. Every component of this nozzle exemplifies this - it has heft, each component seems to work/adjust so smoothly but firmly.  One parting advice is if you do use a garden hose frequently, it's worth it to go down to your local hardware or garden supply store and test them.

It can capture every angle of my entire living room. Excellent swivel. The problem is, it only works once per day. I can access a view of my living room once. When I close the app and try to look at it again later in the day to monitor my puppy, the app can't connect to the camera. I've tried everything...logging out, restarting my phone, even uninstalling and reinstalling the app. Third day in a row of this frustrating BS where it only works the first time I use it. The rest of the day? Nothing. I can't makes sense of it, but we will sadly be returning it and hopefully finding something better.

4182,4182,"I do like this product, but it wasn't quite as easy to install as I had hoped.  On a 30 year old house with 24"" joist spacing, I found a lot of rock wool above my ceiling.  So it can be messy, be prepared for that.   The brace seemed to walk away from me on the long side - maybe i should have planned to center mount the electrical box?  Anyway, I made a mistake trying to use a cable clamp instead of the supplied grommet strain relief.  That interfered with the saddle clamp.  I discovered this once I decided to climb into the attic to inspect.  One side of the brace had walked nearly to the top of the ceiling joist.  It took a couple of trips into the attic to get the brace set properly, but it wasn't so bad.  I used two hands to tighten the worm-screw shaft, no tools.  The ends of the brace do tend to want to walk away rather than bight in, so you have to keep after them - easier to do with eyes on it.  I don't think I could do it blind (from below ceiling).  I was able to get the brace plenty tight with two hands.  I did use some blue painters tape on the ceiling to keep the electrical box from falling while I was in the attic because you have to remove the saddle clamp while you turn the brace to get it set.  There is a small powerful magnet supplied with this unit for that purpose, but I guess I wanted some insurance.  My attic access was a real bear and I'm not very flexible at my age.  I'd buy this product again.  It's sturdy.  I highly recommend a DC motor ceiling fan, because, you don't need a wall switch, just unswitched power which isn't too tough to find in my attic.  DC fans are ultra quiet.  And remote control is the way to go.  DO REMEMBER TO TURN OFF THE CIRCUIT BREAKER when working with unswitched power.  Use a contactless voltage detector to verify power is off.  some attic tools I used:  knee pads, head light, drop light, small planks to provide a surface for crawling, kneeling, standing, etc.",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,"[3706, 2245, 4303, 7856, 994, 3996, 5955, 409, 2407, 7944, 3878, 409, 3706, 3409, 5118, 3, 8857, 5109, 3659, 8739, 4062, 3706, 3055, 3, 4414, 5083, 6426, 8773, 9, 4851, 7062, 3996, 1059, 605, 605, 5728, 3024, 7801, 853, 6676, 7944, 8506, 504, 3097, 4583, 5118, 7801, 4386, 6879, 4579, 3706, 6853, 3488, 5542, 7944, 1163, 4811, 7801, 2453, 3706, 4465, 3, 4728, 8111, 7944, 8330, 3, 1023, 1289, 3894, 5083, 7801, 7575, 3347, 7418, 7796, 3933, 8739, 7801, 6513, 3706, 2184, 7856, 5121, 3706, 1914, 7944, 1336, 3946, 7801, 468, 7944, 5122, 6879, 5083, 7801, 853, 3409, 8507, 4894, 7944, 7801, 7983, 5083, 7801, 1152, 3996, 7977, 3, 1688, 5083, 8091, 3946, 7801, 468, 7944, 3207, 7801, 853, 6744, 994, 3996, 7062, 3706, 8334, 8151, 3444, 7944, 7902, 7801, 4972, 7801, 2507, 5083, 7801, 853, 2245, 7755, 7944, 8522, 7944, 8506, 504, 6006, 7786, 701, 7062, 8870, 3488, 7944, 4087, 159, 7809, 2401, 7944, 2245, 8739, 2709, 5118, 3706, 7846, 3706, 1677, 2245, 3996, 752, 665, 3706, 8541, 6, 7944, 3207, 7801, 853, 5576, 7901, 8739, 8151, 3706, 2115, 8330, 7105, 769, 5278, 7695, 5118, 7801, 1152, 7944, 4087, 7801, 2453, 844, 3097, 2748, 8665, 3706, 8541, 3773, 7801, 468, 626, 8870, 3488, 7944, 6206, 7801, 6513, 1289, 8665, 8870, 8131, 7801, 853, 7944, 3207, 3996, 7819, 3981, 3, 7017, 5694, 4468, 7575, 8739, 7856, 8235, 3024, 7796, 994, 3706, 3373, 3706, 8523, 7105, 4851, 468, 29, 8541, 3, 6026, 613, 278, 4994, 8432, 2943, 448, 4851, 1005, 7856, 5790, 3706, 3567, 6078, 3, 1889, 4808, 1152, 8870, 4906, 3, 8515, 4081, 8276, 5692, 8663, 7976, 8006, 7944, 2856, 3773, 4851, 1889, 2759, 376, 8168, 278, 6202, 1609, 3981, 7801, 8583, 7944, 2245, 6192, 7944, 8131, 5085, 7801, 1274, 880, 8655, 8783, 8739, 8276, 8330, 3, 1583, 8486, 2079, 7944, 8419, 5692, 3981, 7105, 468, 7981, 3706, 4126, 3501, 2344, 7017, 5541, 7944, 5848, 3, 7591, 3024]"

4200,4200,"The Expert Gardener 4 Twist Nozzle is a very good basic hose nozzle. The nozzle has only one control/adjustment. I like the simplicity of the design and use. The nozzle simply rotates to either shut off all water flow or open up to allow first a narrow high velocity water flow. If you continue to rotate the nozzle it becomes a softer wider angle lower velocity flow of water. With four twists the nozzle goes from closed (no water flow) to full blast. The Expert Gardener 4 Twist Nozzle is quite simple to use and it works effectively. The Nozzle rotation control is the only adjustment. I like the fact that the nozzle does not have a squeeze handle, it keeps things simple. This device is so simple in concept, design and operation there is nothing to dislike. The plastic on the twisting device is soft to the touch and feels good when making rotational adjustments. The Expert Gardener 4 Twist Nozzle is an excellent tool for your garden watering.

4362,4362,"I have recently recieved the ""Expert Gardener 4 Twist Nozzle"" for a water hose from the Walmart Sparks program. It is a pretty good design, doesn't feel cheap or of poor quality. It screws onto any standard hose end. To operate you just twist the end open and choose how you need the water to come out. Depending on how far you twist it, you can set the water pressure to your needs. Twisting it all the way open keeps the water as a stiff stream with a good bit of pressure, keeping it barely open creates a mist of water. The nozzle itself is made out of decent quality brass with grey rubber grip material for easy handling. It's easy to utilize and easy to remove after use. I use these types of nozzles instead of the others with the handles. They tend to jam up and break easily. This brass twist nozzle has never jammed up with me and is practically impossible to break. I have never had any issues with this device and always resort to using this instead of other options offered in stores. I am satisfied with this product and will definitely reccomend it to others.See more",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,"[3706, 3488, 6062, 6069, 7801, 3167, 8147, 3024, 3, 8566, 3650, 3097, 7801, 8518, 7152, 3996, 3981, 3, 5743, 3265, 2802, 1214, 5167, 5083, 5643, 3996, 6618, 5133, 313, 7314, 3650, 7944, 5141, 8870, 4081, 8147, 7801, 2502, 5134, 278, 1254, 3670, 8870, 4906, 7801, 8566, 7944, 1425, 2015, 5118, 3670, 2762, 8870, 8147, 8870, 1059, 6744, 7801, 8566, 5737, 7944, 8874, 8149, 3996, 213, 7801, 8583, 5134, 4090, 7801, 8566, 409, 3, 7377, 7432, 8739, 3, 3265, 722, 5083, 4089, 3996, 567, 5134, 1752, 3, 4727, 5083, 7801, 5022, 4005, 3981, 4465, 5204, 5083, 1909, 5930, 872, 8739, 3328, 6481, 3334, 4565, 3024, 2407, 2407, 7944, 8360, 278, 2407, 7944, 6206, 159, 3706, 8330, 7828, 8156, 5083, 5023, 3894, 5083, 7801, 5198, 8739, 7801, 7831, 7755, 7944, 4022, 8290, 278, 877, 7856, 872, 8147, 5022, 3478, 4942, 4026, 8290, 8739, 4583, 278, 3981, 5697, 3756, 7944, 3706, 3488, 4942, 3409, 313, 3993, 8739, 7856, 2096, 278, 245, 6314, 7944, 8351, 7856, 3894, 5083, 5197, 5164, 5089, 3773, 3706, 246, 6547, 8739, 7856, 5790, 278, 8703, 1957, 6055, 3996, 7944, 4788]"

White metal will look horrible with any wear. Also, the flap cover sounds like plastic, when I tap it with something metal, and is warm to the touch. It is not brass either.

4544,4544,"I bought this kit to practice/try replacing screen mesh on an old screen before deciding whether I wanted to tackle replacing the mesh on my sun screens.The fiberglass mesh and spline are good quality, but the spline roller is poor. Also, the rollers on the ends are different, and there is no explanation in the instructions as to when you should/would use end versus the other. I think if you are going to replace more than one screen, it'd be worth investing in a good-quality spline roller.The directions on the package were a little confusing, and the images on the package are too small to help.The video on the HomeDepot product page for using this product features a different spline roller than included in the kit.  I looked online for a video by the company showing how to use this kit and couldn't find one. But there are plenty of videos online that use the type of tool included in the kit that'll help you with the process.The screen material is folded in the bag, and there were fold marks on the fabric after I spread it out over the frame. Because the fold marks were pressed into the fabric from being in the package so long, it was hard to smooth them out when installing the mesh into the frame. I would suggest taking the mesh out and laying or hanging it flat for a day or two for the folds to hang out. I would not iron the mesh as it's fiberglass and could melt. You could also replace the mesh in the screen and let the tension smooth the folds, then take the spline out, stretch the mesh, and reinsert the spline.At any rate, I'm glad I purchased this kit to practice with. It's very easy. I have decided that I am going to replace the mesh on my sun screens.

Many of the features that do not require a cloud based service are disabled as soon as the subscription option is eliminated.I learned this because I wanted to use the system without the subscription, and I didn't want to wait 30 days after the trial ended to find out what functionality would no longer be available for use, so I canceled the subscription early.I understand the incentive to offer subscription based products, it's a great business model, but to offer a product whose primary function is so hamstrung as to be unusable once one opts not to subscribe any further, is ingenuine, misleading and does nothing but undermine trust and loyalty in the Blink / Amazon brand.Amazon / Blink, just be honest, it's so much better than manipulating us.Note: this does not even begin to get into the one hour and thirty eight minutes I spent on the phone with two tech support agents, who I ultimately ended up teaching about two subjects they were completely unaware of.One: If you're want to use the Sync Module 2, a USB 2.0 stick won't work, it must be USB 3.0 or higherTwo: If you do subscribe to the cloud service, the warranty on the unit is extended for the full duration of the subscription.Neither agent knew anything about either subject.If you don't want/plan to subscribe to the cloud service, don't buy this.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[7856, 1046, 278, 7801, 7648, 7796, 3254, 8739, 3996, 376, 2783, 1013, 7856, 3024, 3, 756, 5851, 8870, 3, 1885, 8071, 3024, 7801, 1364, 579, 7801, 6357, 8714, 3024, 7801, 5790, 3981, 236, 7796, 3981, 4994, 1013, 3723, 4303, 4583, 278, 8813, 4303, 7944, 8330, 7856, 7648, 8741, 7801, 94, 1665, 5083, 3, 7801, 5410, 8857, 7856, 1046, 409, 8628, 409, 7801, 7644, 4756, 7796, 3981, 7944, 221, 8870, 7944, 8330, 4362, 4662, 409, 8628, 605, 4972, 4532, 5083, 7801, 2790, 7796, 2245, 4994, 6269, 3, 1364, 579, 6739, 376, 2153, 409, 7118, 409, 7801, 7506, 5163, 3981, 4241, 7856, 626, 3706, 8523, 7944, 8330, 7801, 7648, 8741, 7801, 278, 3706, 8522, 7944, 8498, 1887, 159, 7801, 8071, 2503, 7944, 2856, 5204, 8646, 3120, 8813, 4972, 4387, 605, 490, 3024, 7062, 3706, 1062, 7801, 7506, 8207, 7801, 3779, 7944, 5088, 7506, 579, 3, 3315, 987, 994, 7944, 5088, 3, 5790, 8678, 5763, 3118, 3981, 7062, 3428, 409, 7944, 605, 8281, 5121, 5122, 5165, 4994, 7944, 7503, 313, 3981, 4717, 278, 2250, 5001, 994, 8203, 8106, 278, 4439, 3773, 7801, 756, 252, 4081, 605, 7062, 4833, 684, 7786, 4518, 7856, 2250, 4994, 2588, 647, 7944, 3207, 3946, 7801, 5122, 3657, 278, 7855, 2441, 4698, 3706, 7180, 5118, 7801, 5465, 8739, 8151, 7717, 7582, 8673, 3706, 8167, 2503, 8290, 7709, 8, 8151, 7501, 7831, 8639, 1483, 8178, 3723, 8522, 7944, 8330, 7801, 7644, 4756, 3, 8328, 7371, 3996, 4848, 605, 8328, 5167, 3723, 8870, 2245, 7503, 7944, 7801, 1364, 7801, 8539, 5118, 7801, 8235, 3981, 2693, 3024, 7801, 3113, 2375, 5083, 7801, 166, 4129, 318, 8, 2442, 8870, 7944, 7503, 7944, 7801, 1364, 1005]"

4768,4768,"I was a big fan of Wyze and their products until recently. Their intense focus on expanding their product offerings has resulted in taking their ""eye of the ball"" of their bread and butter product, the cam. A few months ago, they sent out a software update for the cameras that was flawed, and they still have not completely corrected it. The problem was that, when the camera detected a sound or motion alert, the clip you are provided to review is missing the first 5 or 6 seconds of recording after the alert was detected. They sent out a software update about a month ago that corrected the sound alert clips, but the motion clips are still not working correctly. If you rely on these cameras to monitor your home or property, be aware of this issue because it will not provide you with complete motion detection monitoring until the software is fixed.I even emailed Elana Fishman, their COO to let her know about the fault and potential liability risk to the company. I did not receive a response and was instead contacted again by Level 1 support who instructed me on how to fallback to a previous release that did not have this malfunction.

I am constantly losing signal to cameras, I can walk across the street to neighbors garage and still have WiFi on my phone/tablet so it's not my WiFi router signal; now even though there is a ""reconnect"" option in the app, it doesn't work. The only way I can reconnect is to physically push the reset button on the camera itself to enter set up mode, push again to exit setup and reconnect. Why there is an option on the app which doesn't reconnect is beyond me. If I'm not home and able to physically go to the affected camera and push reset, I can't reconnect it until I get home...pretty useless if I was on vacation and unable to manually reset camera.There is no local storage options at all, so if you do not subscribe to a ring plan your cameras are only good for real time viewing. If your vehicle is burglarized over night and you're not on a ring plan there is no footage to review. I'm selling all my ring cams and going with another brand that has local storage option, keeping my footage at my house where I'm in control of it...! My suggestion is PoE(Power over Ethernet) camera system with an NVR(Network Video Recorder) which contains a hard drive where video is stored locally at your house. There are plenty of these type systems for all budgets, a simple google search will get you started. If you can operate a drill and a screwdriver you can install this type of system or you can purchase it and pay a professional service.

4937,4937,It's only been in use for less than a month so this review reflects limited use. I purchased this to replace another brand that I bought earlier and installed at my daughter's house in Baltimore. That one was powered by battery and that was the issue as it stopped keeping charge. This time I opted for Ring with direct power supply. Syncing with her WiFi and software set up on her iPhone was a breeze (a lot smoother than previous brand). Product comes with all necessary hardware. She has a parking pad through a back alley and that's where we installed it.

4964,4964,"A standard pistol-grip hose-end sprayer. Nice heft, comfortable low-slip grip, doesn't leak at the hose connection and is very responsive, from a nice soft cone pattern to a perfectly-focused jet. The sprayer has threads on the end (with an open cap to cover/protect them) - apparently Gilmour has some attachments for this sprayer (search Gilmour model 5501), but none looked especially useful to me. What I DO expect to get some use from is the LIFETIME WARRANTY on this sprayer. I've never seen a pistol-grip hose sprayer that was worth a flip after a year or three so if Gilmour is going to stand behind this one forever, I hardly see how I can go wrong. One issue I did have is that mine leaked annoyingly from the front nozzle. I nearly returned it to the store but decided to try and tighten the brass core first. After pulling the big rubber thread guard and squeezing the handle to retract the center pin, I was able to use a spoon to tighten the brass core another quarter-turn, which fixed the problem. I've only had it for a day but so far, I love it!LikesQualityDurabilityWaterOperationEase of useConstructionSturdinessFunctionalityGripValue for moneySprayerPressureHandleSee more",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,"[3, 7314, 4954, 1429, 4232, 448, 7801, 3650, 1545, 278, 3981, 8432, 3097, 3, 4954, 7078, 1525, 5352, 7944, 3, 7801, 7234, 3478, 7869, 5118, 7801, 2502, 271, 5134, 1079, 7944, 333, 3218, 3478, 7105, 459, 3024, 7856, 7234, 3218, 4743, 994, 4982, 4393, 2571, 8337, 7944, 8646, 3706, 2245, 2668, 7944, 3207, 7105, 8330, 3097, 3981, 7801, 4289, 8539, 5118, 7856, 4942, 6679, 3, 3650, 7234, 7796, 8541, 8807, 3, 2951, 159, 3, 8857, 5167, 7870, 7062, 3723, 3218, 3981, 3256, 7944, 7313, 654, 7856, 5122, 3706, 3467, 6665, 3670, 3706, 1059, 3249, 5122, 3991, 3706, 2115, 3488, 3981, 7796, 4680, 4234, 295, 3097, 7801, 3098, 3706, 4894, 6359, 3996, 7944, 7801, 7402, 994, 1914, 7944, 8110, 278, 7902, 7801, 872, 1649, 159, 5872, 7801, 696, 6481, 7866, 3371, 278, 7280, 7801, 3440, 7944, 6350, 7801, 1163, 3706, 8541, 6, 7944, 8330, 3, 7222, 7944, 7902, 7801, 872, 1649, 297, 8663, 2902, 7801, 5130, 3409, 3996, 3024, 3, 1885, 994, 7062, 3706, 4422, 5083, 8333, 3024, 4773, 4788]"

With the old oscillating sprinklers that I had (the ones that go back and forth), I had to drag them out to the middle of the lawn, so the hose was on top of the grass.

There is also a brass adjustment at the top so if the water doesn't stop completely when you release the handle, just twist the top nut back a rotation or two and that should work.

5640,5640,Over the years I have tried and used many types of hose nozzles here at my home in Florida. I have a pool and lots of plants on my pool deck and in flower beds in my yard. I was very interested to get and try this 8-pattern nozzle for the many types of water uses/projects I have here. The first thing I noticed and liked was the on/off valve was quite different than most nozzles I have used in the past.

I played with it to make sure it released as it should. The pex rings were behind my furnace. Of course it has to be a tight spot and the tool locked up on me all four tumes.

I'm always concerned about the dry mulch picking up a hot ember, so when a nearby fire occurs I like to soak down the mulch. I strategically placed this sprinkler where it will water most of the mulch area near our house. I'll probably add another at some point. The quick coupler system makes it fast and easy to attach the hose and get it up and running. One thing to be aware of and to be sure to plan accordingly, the upright hose will block a portion of the spray if it ends up being in the selected spray zone. Plan this out so the connection is to the rear of the area you plan to water. A 90 degree adapter could prove useful in certain situations to keep the hose horizontal below the spray zone.

All of my pex are cut on an angle. I tried adjusting the blade but no use. Definitely recommend buying another set.Original reviews*******The mesh case is of good quality as are the cutters. The crimp rings will serve their purpose as far as I can tell.Where this set falls flat is the crimpers. Apparently I didn't realize the amount of strength required to actually crimp a ring with these. As another reviewer said, you need a 3rd hand. Your hands will be on the ends of the crimper, which are spread a reasonable distance apart. The difficult part comes when trying to squeeze the handles together to crimp. The motion is similar to bolt cutters, and you're met with a lot of resistance. To make things more difficult, the ring can move around on the pex pipe when you're trying to crimp it. And the space where the crimp ring tab goes is pretty close to the size of the tab so there isn't a whole lot of room for error.If I had to do it again, I would either go the copper ring crimp route or a 1-handed crimp tool.
