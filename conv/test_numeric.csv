42,42,"Great easy to use app, add new devices by simply scanning a QRC code. Sets up in a couple of minutes. Nice customizable control settings for motion detection zones, lights, video, & notifications. You can link devices so if one device detects motion other devices will start recording. Linking chimes are easy the app even gives you device health status. Easy to snooze motion if you are working outside. You can manually turn on the lights and a siren too if you like. Easy to replay and save videos. I like the people only motion sensitivity mode but not the color night vision. It makes the video look odd with the colors added.1. The installation is easy and instructions are accurate. Well thought out, except for one glaring omission. I would bet most people who buy the Wired camera drill a hole through the house and plug it in at the garage door opener outlet. The problem is that the plug is Giant and Nobody wants to drill a Giant hole (probably at least 11/4 "") in their wall to pull the plug through for a small cable. Ring should be able to figure this out themselves, maybe with a quick connect/disconnect on the cord near the plug? You really need to practice installing these in real world situations Ring.I was able to figure this out myself by removing 4 small screws from the light base and pull off the cover. There you see the +/- power leads and remove the 2 really small screws holding them down. Remove the 2 really tiny screws that holds a small metal bracket that attaches the cable to the base and pull the cable out. From here you only need to drill a 1/2"" to 5/8"" max hole through your house. Slide the cable through the wall then reassemble in reverse order without losing any of the tiny screws.2. When I went to register my new device for the free 30 day trial their system put my existing device on the trial ( I have the one year paid subscription on that one) and showed the new device not on any trial or plan.

This is all really nice for longevity.I like the adjustments and find this sprinkler works just as well as the old plastic one it replaces only it's definitely more adjustable.

Low and behold, the lens is completely destroyed, apparently by exposure to UV. Two things stand out to me:1. Prior to buying, I specifically asked Ring Tech Support if these cameras would be damaged by our Arizona UV and was assured this would not be a problem.2. Ring apparently uses polymer lenses in their cameras intended for exterior use. I find this unacceptable, especially give my experience at 3 1/2yrs in. See pictures. Although I've been fairly happy with Ring, I cannot recommend this camera for exterior use and will now have to migrate my home over to something that is UV tolerant.

Unlike the old flapper style, this ""cannister"" design drops and shuts off the water flow as soon as you release the handle. It's going to be embarrassing having to explain to guests how to operate the toilet correctly.

Since my lawn is only about 20' x 20', I moved the dial to the lowest setting and it worked perfect. I did move the dial to the full setting but ended up watering my neighbors lawn as well. The construction seems well built and the bottom of the impact sprinkler is made from what looks like aluminum so it shouldn't rust either. I have only had the sprinkler for about a week and we are getting plenty of rain right now, so I will give it heavier use later in the spring and summer. It covers the entire lawn so I don't have to constantly move the sprinkler from spot to spot like I had to with my old sprinkler. The pictures I included details the dial on the top of the sprinkler.

Every time we flush, it makes a loud 'Bang' sound.  We have been in contact with tech support from Ove, and per their suggestions, we have tried to reset the system, replace the solenoid.  We also tried difference connections: we first started with Ove shut-off value without water hammer arrester, then we installed the water hammer arrester, that didn't help, then we tried with the 3/8 shut-off valve connection.  But none of the above works.  (Please note: Ove didn't have any field technicians to help us to replace any parts or connect the toilet with difference methods.  All the works were done by a plumber, hired by us!)  Now, they are saying our water pipe need to strap down, well, that is easy, just knock a few walls and tight it down.  Even if we are willing to go that far, there is no guarantee that it will work.  We have disk washer machine, washer machine for cloth etc.â€¦ all work nicely and QUIETLY. So, I believe there is a defect in their design.  The 2 years warranty from Ove only go as far as sending us parts, we still need to pay someone to do the work, and there is limited number of parts they can send us, they won't give us a replacement or credit toward another product. so at the end of day, we got a $1200+ toilet sitting there for the look, and if we need some attention, we hit the flush button, and it will go 'bang', 'bang', 'bang'.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"[8587, 3488, 7801, 4261, 7021, 7957, 6916, 3996, 3981, 3265, 8587, 2813, 3024, 278, 8587, 827, 3996, 3981, 4081, 3024, 7801, 4392, 8587, 376, 4994, 1429, 8351, 3996, 2596, 7918, 8587, 3996, 4495, 3, 4417, 8587, 3488, 639, 3773, 1580, 8739, 7717, 7582, 3097, 278, 5410, 7806, 8587, 3488, 8077, 7944, 6298, 7801, 6241, 7801, 8587, 236, 8077, 2124, 8587, 2888, 7329, 8739, 5225, 8376, 8741, 8566, 3421, 7816, 8587, 3882, 7801, 8566, 3421, 7796, 7816, 8587, 8077, 8739, 7801, 8379, 994, 4982, 5083, 7801, 9, 5225, 3488, 313, 2829, 7720, 7944, 3533, 8322, 7944, 6241, 313, 5322, 5167, 1542, 7801, 7957, 8739, 2124, 213, 7801, 8790, 8639, 2265, 1013, 3, 3576, 1013, 7831, 376, 6566, 5201, 8566, 5510, 4906, 7944, 7426, 7796, 3981, 4081, 4134, 3, 2819, 8517, 278, 7901, 3996, 2588, 3723, 8587, 376, 8705, 7944, 3249, 7796, 7819, 3981, 4972, 3369, 7796, 3996, 8703, 8587, 3488, 2191, 8545, 8545, 4461, 3024, 1361, 213, 8776, 4955, 278, 3706, 659, 7819, 3981, 3, 1942, 3773, 7806, 7801, 8859, 8539, 3097, 5225, 5130, 3249, 409, 2762, 409, 6702, 8322, 8587, 7380, 4906, 7944, 5368, 7108, 7944, 2245, 7801, 278, 7819, 3981, 4321, 5031, 5083, 5322, 7831, 1059, 6701, 7831, 3225, 8322, 3, 6244, 5167, 1755, 8012, 297, 7062, 448, 7801, 2502, 5083, 8587, 3274, 3, 7957, 6931, 7819, 3024, 7801, 278, 3723, 8587, 4906, 7105, 8587, 3582, 7801, 2988, 278, 3996, 8703, 3249]"

427,427,"I received this item to evaluate and I was happy to accept it. I have always thought very highly of Rain Bird products and have used them for many years. They make the best sprinkler heads I've ever owned. That being said, I'm going to be a bit critical.This item is an in-ground sprinkler with a quick disconnect for your garden hose. It is designed to be mounted flush with the surface and uses an impulse sprinkler which can be adjusted for both distance and circumference. The sprinkler head itself measures about 4"" across at the cap in depth into the ground is 9"". The second part is a bit wider (5"") and mounts about 8 in. away from the sprinkler head itself. It's only 5"" tall but you will still have to dig down 9"" to make room for the hose adapter. The lid locks in place so you don't have to worry about it coming loose with from a lawnmower even a good one that has good vacuum power. The instructions state this can water up to 41 feet across in a full circle. This measurement depends on your water pressure and can vary by a few feet. Normal water pressure is generally between 40 and 60 PSI and my house runs at the higher end at 60-65 PSI this really covers a large area for me. As with any impulse style sprinkler head the distance can be adjusted at the front and the circumference can be adjusted anywhere from 0 to 360Â°. You will have to adjusted with the water on because this unit has a pretty beefy spring that holds a down. As you can see by one of the pictures, I'm using a bamboo stick to hold it in place so I can take a picture the sprinkler head and the stick is being bent from the spring tension. There is a lot of positive things to say about this model because it was built very well but I don't feel this would be of use for the average homeowner, unless they had a small yard or area needing watered. The reason I say this is because this is basically a sprinkler that you can never move around. It sprays in a circle, or half circle, or quarter circle (whatever you want) but it only does one area and wherever you bury it is where it stays. Plus, the colder northern areas where the ground freezes down a foot or more this thing could freeze as you blow it out like with a typical in-ground sprinkler system. That being said, this is one heavy duty sprinkler head and can easily be adapted to a regular sprinkler system as the input is threaded for generic adapters.So, I gave this four stars. Five stars for the Rain Bird quality that I've known for years and only three stars as this is not very practical for a typical homeowner as most homes do not have a just a single dedicated area for something like this. Since you still have to drag the hose out and put the adapter on, why not just get a regular impulse sprinkler that you can use everywhere in your yard?I will be adding this to my in-ground sprinkler system on its own zone since I have a large area of landscaping where this would work great. But if I had a choice of using one that would be permanently installed and I would have to hook a garden hose to every time, or just use a regular lawn sprinkler that I could use anywhere in my yard I would choose the latter. Rain Bird should sell these sprinkler heads separately because I really like these to use in an in-ground system.I would recommend it to a friend, but only if I knew they had an area where this would come in handy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"[3706, 6058, 7856, 3999, 7944, 2585, 278, 3706, 8541, 3461, 7944, 24, 3706, 3488, 245, 7862, 8432, 3567, 5083, 5978, 716, 5793, 278, 3488, 8334, 7809, 3024, 4532, 7831, 4494, 7801, 682, 7250, 3505, 2595, 7796, 657, 3256, 7944, 605, 3, 722, 3999, 3981, 271, 7250, 8739, 3, 5941, 2172, 3024, 8874, 3164, 3996, 3981, 2046, 7944, 605, 4813, 2988, 8739, 7801, 7591, 278, 8346, 271, 3771, 7250, 8663, 1059, 605, 115, 3024, 814, 2220, 278, 7801, 7250, 3501, 4005, 4593, 8, 64, 448, 7801, 1079, 3773, 2029, 3946, 7801, 3354, 3981, 7801, 6651, 5312, 3981, 3, 722, 8687, 278, 4815, 8, 504, 3097, 7801, 7250, 3501, 5130, 7686, 994, 8870, 8703, 7380, 3488, 7944, 2132, 2288, 7944, 4494, 6446, 3024, 7801, 3650, 7801, 4284, 4374, 3773, 5530, 7062, 8870, 3488, 7944, 8802, 8, 3996, 1433, 4399, 8739, 3097, 3, 4217, 2588, 3, 3265, 5122, 7796, 3478, 3265, 8370, 7801, 3900, 7334, 7856, 1059, 8566, 8290, 7944, 2807, 64, 3773, 3, 3113, 7856, 4591, 2016, 5118, 8874, 8566, 5737, 278, 1059, 8395, 1013, 3, 2819, 4987, 8566, 5737, 3981, 3195, 686, 278, 5858, 278, 4851, 3659, 6498, 448, 7801, 3564, 2502, 448, 5858, 7856, 6032, 1708, 3, 4190, 377, 3024, 409, 8739, 313, 3771, 7490, 7250, 3501, 7801, 2220, 1059, 605, 115, 448, 7801, 3098, 278, 7801, 1276, 1059, 605, 115, 322, 3097, 7944, 8870, 8703, 3488, 7944, 115, 8739, 7801, 8566, 5118, 626, 7856, 8235, 3478, 3, 5743, 638, 7245, 7796, 3604, 3, 409, 8870, 1059, 6665, 1013, 5122, 5083, 7801, 8351, 3, 550, 7371, 7944, 3600, 3996, 3773, 5530, 7062, 3706, 1059, 7674, 3, 5487, 7801, 7250, 3501, 278, 7801, 7371, 3981, 657, 675, 3097, 7801, 7245, 7819, 3981, 3, 4414, 5083, 5665, 7845, 7944, 6565, 8, 7856, 4743, 626, 3996, 8541, 950, 8432, 8628, 994, 3706, 2802, 7856, 8813, 605, 5083, 8330, 3024, 7801, 492, 8240, 7831, 3409, 3, 7017, 8850, 5167, 377, 4909, 7801, 6037, 3706, 6565, 7856, 3981, 626, 7856, 3981, 584, 3, 7250, 7796, 8870, 1059, 4942, 4818, 3996, 7238, 3773, 3, 5167, 3416, 5167, 5936, 1273, 8870, 994, 3996, 5130, 2250, 5122, 377, 278, 8660, 8870, 984, 3996, 3981, 8658, 3996, 7801, 1394, 4992, 378, 8658, 7801, 3354, 3079, 2288, 3, 3018, 5167, 4788, 7856, 7844, 1677, 3078, 409, 8870, 764, 3996, 5204, 4303, 8739, 3, 8157, 7250, 7796, 657, 7856, 3981, 5122, 3522, 2381, 7250, 3501, 278, 1059, 2403, 605, 85, 7944, 3, 6146, 7250, 7648, 409, 7801, 3858, 3981, 7867, 3024, 3198, 3706, 3183, 7856, 3060, 2899, 7327, 3024, 7801, 5978, 716, 5930, 7796, 4145, 3024, 8859, 278, 5130, 7870, 7327, 409, 7856, 3981, 4994, 8432, 5696, 3024, 3, 8157, 3617, 409, 4801, 3619, 2245, 4994, 3488, 3, 4081, 3, 6918, 1928, 377, 3024, 7109, 4303, 6916, 8870, 7380, 3488, 7944, 2299, 7801, 3650, 5204, 278, 5907, 7801, 86, 8679, 4994, 4081, 3207, 3, 6146, 3771, 7250, 7796, 8870, 1059, 8330, 2604, 3773, 8874, 8703, 605, 92, 7856, 7944, 4851, 7250, 7648, 5118, 4003, 5248, 8897, 6916, 3706, 3488, 3, 4190, 377, 5083, 4187, 8658, 7856, 8813, 8776, 994, 3723, 3706, 3409, 3, 1252, 5083, 8351, 5122, 7796, 8813, 605, 5435, 3882, 278, 3706, 8813, 3488, 7944, 3629, 3, 3164, 3650, 7944, 2596, 5167, 4081, 8330, 3, 6146, 4215, 7250, 7796, 3706, 1677, 8330, 322, 3773, 4851, 8850, 3706, 8813, 1254, 7801, 5978, 716, 6853, 6695, 7828, 7250, 3505, 6719, 626, 3706, 6032, 4303, 7828, 7944, 8330, 3773, 271, 8813, 6078, 3996, 7944, 3, 994, 5130, 3723, 3706, 4129, 7831, 3409, 271, 377, 8658, 7856, 8813, 1425, 3773]"

I was able to get the width to fit the chairs OK, but the cushion's seat extends beyond the chair edge - it wasn't too bad to adjust to this feature. The depth is super plush and comfortable! Because the chairs' back is rounded the pillows are fine.

682,682,The springs are not super strong. I have a pair of clamps that are so strong I can almost not open them up. These have about the pressure you'd expect for the size. The way the body of the clamp is formed there's a hollow area underneath the pad where you hold objects. If you are clamping some thin wood while the glue sets up you would most likely need to use calls under the clamp so that the hollow area didn't affect your gluing surface. The problems I have with these clams may just be due to unfamiliarity. All my other clamps like this are plastic. The two sides can be off as much as 3/16 to a quarter of an inch.

704,704,"The project intended for this item was an outdoor shower. However several of the parts needed for completion were back ordered and will not be received for 2-3 weeks and I didn't want to wait to write the review. The water line is of Â¾ inch PEX tubing (picture 1) and I was amazed at how easily it cut with the Kobalt cutter. The cut ends are clean and there is no deviation in the tubing, which makes inserting fittings much easier. In picture number 2 you can see the difference between the ""Factory cut"" and the Kobalt cut, with the factory cut on the right and showing that the Kobalt cut is even cleaner. The cutter fits well in your grip and it cuts effortlessly through the tubing, which means less fatigue during large projects. The blades are easily removed and replaced (pictures 3 & 4) and replacements are available at Lowes (part #2146990). While using the cutter I found it is also useful in the installation of irrigation tubing, which I use in our flower beds and garden. It easily and cleanly cuts the Â¼ inch drip tubing, which I have previously cut with diagonal pliers and which tends to squash the tube and make it difficult to attach to fittings or multi distribution ports. I understand the Kobalt cutter can also be used to cut Poly Pipe, since I haven't used it in that capacity, I can only assume it will perform the same with that material. With the Kobalt cutter the cut is clean with minimal deviation, which makes the job go much easier and quickly. I'm happy to have this in my toolbox and look forward to it providing many years of service.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"[7801, 5805, 3918, 3024, 7856, 3999, 8541, 271, 5208, 3671, 6752, 5083, 7801, 5322, 4908, 3024, 1486, 8639, 520, 5174, 278, 8703, 4994, 605, 6058, 3024, 8613, 278, 3706, 8522, 7944, 8498, 7944, 8831, 7801, 7801, 8566, 4325, 3981, 5083, 8910, 3781, 5454, 8115, 278, 3706, 8541, 249, 448, 3670, 2403, 3996, 1836, 8739, 7801, 4150, 7801, 1836, 2507, 376, 1310, 278, 7819, 3981, 4972, 2095, 3773, 7801, 8663, 4495, 3865, 2898, 4833, 3773, 5487, 5031, 8870, 1059, 6665, 7801, 2124, 686, 7801, 278, 7801, 4150, 8739, 7801, 2731, 1836, 5118, 7801, 6397, 278, 6863, 7796, 7801, 4150, 1836, 3981, 2588, 7801, 1842, 2895, 8628, 3773, 8874, 3334, 278, 3996, 1841, 2439, 7879, 7801, 8663, 4586, 4268, 2778, 2376, 4190, 7801, 734, 376, 2403, 6208, 278, 6243, 278, 6245, 376, 490, 448, 4435, 8665, 8351, 7801, 1842, 3706, 3055, 3996, 3981, 236, 8337, 3773, 7801, 3879, 5083, 3979, 8663, 3706, 8330, 3773, 5201, 2973, 635, 278, 3996, 2403, 278, 1315, 1841, 7801, 8909, 3781, 2331, 8663, 3706, 3488, 5750, 1836, 8739, 2107, 5583, 278, 8663, 7758, 7944, 7272, 7801, 8113, 278, 4494, 3996, 2128, 7944, 453, 7944, 2898, 5167, 4838, 2234, 3706, 8207, 7801, 4150, 1842, 1059, 236, 605, 8334, 7944, 1836, 5626, 6916, 3706, 8334, 3996, 3773, 7796, 3706, 1059, 5130, 437, 3996, 8703, 5421, 7801, 6531, 8739, 7796, 8739, 7801, 4150, 1842, 7801, 1836, 3981, 1310, 8739, 4685, 8663, 4495, 7801, 4049, 3249, 4833, 2401, 278, 3461, 7944, 3488, 7856, 3773, 4851, 7979, 278, 4392, 3052, 7944, 3996, 5852, 4532, 8859, 5083]"

I've had this up for a couple of months now and wanted to wait to see if it was really durable before writing a review. It has definitely held up well to repeated clawing by these two dogs, one of which weighs 90 lbs. and the other weighing in at just over 100 lbs.

That said, this is the first time I tried 3/4 inch nails in this gun. They are very short. Maybe that's why they occasionally misfeed. Maybe it's the gun. But DeWalt says 3/4 inch wire collated nails are OK in the model I own.The price of these roofing nails is reasonable. It's tough to find any hardware not made in China today. I'd gladly pay for Made in the USA. I'd rate the overall quality as decent, not great. The packaging was very sturdy, which I appreciate.

1178,1178,"I needed to replace the ceiling fan in our 12 x 14 bedroom. We purchased one from Home Depot (LED lights with remote).

The box that the previous owner had hung the fan from was a regular nail in place plastic box nailed to the joist with one scew stripped out and the other barely hanging on with mostly stripped threads. Why the previous fan never fell on top of us in bed remains a mystery. At least I now know why the old fan wobbled.I purchased this because I previously used one in another bedroom when I replaced a light fixture with a ceiling fan. It worked great. I have no attic and no access above the ceiling. I would have to cut through the torch down roof and the underlayment to install support for a fan.This did the trick. Even though the old box was nailed to the joist, I was able to cut the old nails off through the 4"" hole with a oscillating saw to remove the old box. The joists are on 16"" centers. I placed and tightened the remodel hanger and even though the old box was tight to the joist and the drywall was partially cut over the joist for the 4 "" hole, this hanger let me install a fan now supported on both sides. Rock solid.I don't understand previous comments about not being able to remove, slide or adjust hanger bracket. I did.

1282,1282,"Thought I would spend extra money on a sprinkler for a metal one that would last longer than the plastic ones that never last a season.  My mistake.  First of all, only the frame is metal (not really sure what kind of metal it is - some type of pot metal, magnets don't stick to it), the underside, where the water is piped in, is all plastic. There is a metal coupling that your hose threads into has a thin plastic/rubber ring around it that is supposed to make tightening the coupling to the hose easier.  Except it doesn't.  The plastic ring is just loose around the coupling and within the first day of use immediately was abraded enough on the inner part to make it unusable.  In fact, it made it *more* difficult to tighten or loosen since it just spins around the metal coupling.  Pull that off thinking you can tighten by hand is a mistake also as the outer part of the coupling is closer to jagged serrations than actual an nut head.  Wait! If that is not enough, the coupling does not fit tightly against the inner part of the tubing that goes to the sprinkler, so of course it leaks like a sieve!  Yes I have replaced the inner washers with brand new ones and it made no difference.  Save your money and look elsewhere.  It is simply amazing what companies sell anymore.

I placed one at the top and one midway down the door and tightened them over a period of time.

I ended up having to squeeze with one hand and use my other hand to constantly hold tension against the release lever as the internal return spring is too weak to do it on its own. If I released even the slightest bit of resistance on the lever, the tool would pop wide open and lose any grip it had on the fitting.

In the Texas heat, the plastic cap might end up cracking, so I would suggest replacing it with a metal cap if you are not daisy-chaining other units.

This is until my mother brought home a 30 lb fan instead of a small light fixture. I knew the box couldn't hold a ceiling fan so I had to figure out another solution without tearing the ceiling up. I was able to use this device without making my 4"" hole any larger.. It was perfect. There are two nuts inside that holds a bracket in place that connects the bar to the electrical housing. REMOVE these in order to detach the bar. Once the bar is detached you can install it first. Make sure the bar is level when tightening. Once the bar is tight, you can then clamp the bracket back around the bar and attach the electrical housing. It fit perfectly in the same hole as the other plastic ceiling box that I originally bought.

1751,1751,"I've owned 4 of these toilets to date. The first two worked flawlessly with a super easy install and great rebate offered by local water company. The last two have been nothing but trouble. The tank itself bubbles (NOT the bowl), right by the black enclosure which surrounds the flush valve. After calling Niagara and speaking with 4 different humans and 1 human manager, multiple times, I have been told to continue waiting while an engineer ""researches"" the problem/solution. I have been awaiting a call back with their findings for over 2 weeks, even after I asked for updates along the way. Unfortunately, a bubbling sound is very bothersome and annoying and apparently it's par for the course according to the human manager over at Niagara. He assured me it is just part of the package deal, which is weird because neither of my two previous Niagara toilets had this issue nor could I find another issue mentioned online anywhere. To this date, Niagara has all but given up on providing mediocre customer service to the customers with any sort of real issue. Their default response is to offer a replacement part before they even understand the symptoms. The greatest part about good ole Troy's response over there at Niagara is that the engineer doesn't need to know what I've tried or adjusted or controlled for in all my tinkering with the toilet over the last month. I'm just curious, is there actually some engineer trying to better understand the bubbling in the tank or is the whole idea a waiting game for me to give up, because that's how it feels. I'm disappointed in their lack of honesty and ability to meet customer's needs when it's not just an easy fix, and for that I give the toilet a 1 star rating because it makes a terrible noise every time I flush.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"[5249, 5083, 7828, 7958, 7944, 7801, 2888, 8151, 8780, 2934, 8739, 3, 7567, 2407, 3878, 278, 3315, 6046, 5089, 1013, 4362, 8566, 7801, 4193, 8151, 3488, 639, 5001, 994, 7801, 7692, 4005, 924, 7801, 6397, 1013, 7801, 730, 2499, 8663, 7602, 7801, 2988, 159, 1040, 4952, 278, 7159, 8739, 2126, 3685, 278, 3684, 4839, 3706, 3488, 639, 7961, 7944, 1594, 8501, 8665, 271, 2512, 7801, 3706, 3488, 639, 500, 3, 1036, 520, 8739, 7806, 2858, 3024, 5227, 2588, 159, 3706, 414, 3024, 8293, 232, 7801, 3, 925, 7127, 3981, 8432, 819, 278, 294, 278, 333, 5301, 3024, 7801, 1695, 47, 7944, 7801, 3684, 4510, 5227, 448, 3500, 442, 4583, 3996, 3981, 4081, 5312, 5083, 7801, 5256, 8663, 3981, 8621, 626, 4922, 5083, 4851, 8151, 5749, 4952, 7958, 3409, 7856, 3991, 4985, 1677, 3706, 2856, 297, 3991, 4623, 5129, 7944, 7856, 4952, 3478, 213, 994, 3226, 8290, 5118, 5852, 4602, 1830, 6739, 7944, 7801, 1831, 8739, 313, 7125, 5083, 6026, 7806, 1938, 6321, 3981, 7944, 5088, 3, 6244, 5312, 643, 7831, 2588, 8207, 7801, 7801, 3317, 5312, 8, 3265, 5115, 6321, 5227, 7819, 448, 4952, 3981, 7796, 7801, 2512, 4906, 7944, 4141, 8646, 8077, 5167, 115, 5167, 1611, 3024, 3773, 213, 4851, 7929, 8739, 7801, 7957, 5227, 7801, 4193, 4081, 3981, 7819, 80, 7105, 2512, 8111, 7944, 684, 8207, 7801, 925, 3773, 7801, 7692, 5167, 3981, 7801, 8675, 3714, 3, 8501, 3151, 3024, 4583, 7944, 3225, 626, 3670, 3996, 2159, 3773, 7806, 4166, 5083, 3623, 278, 4, 7944, 4604, 4914, 8655, 4994, 4081, 271, 2407, 278, 3024, 7796, 3706, 3225, 7801, 7957, 3, 7324, 6007, 626, 3996, 4495, 3, 7768, 4976, 2596, 7918, 3706]"

1754,1754,"I already own the Ring Doorbell Pro but the way my garage is recessed on the driveway, the doorbell cam cannot see where I park my car at night. We have had recent occurrences of people checking car doors at night so this camera made sense for safety and security and the light (and sensor) is a good deterrent when it turns on.I mounted this cam above the garage door at an angle that has a full view of my car and all the way across the street. The wide angle lens is excellent and shows a lot of real estate. I chose the wired version since I have an outlet within the distance of the provided power wire (very long) and simply drilled a hole at the spot and ran the cord through the wall (See pictures). The kit comes with wire clamps that can be nailed in every 3 feet or so and it makes it look like a professional install. I then plugged it into the outlet on the ceiling where the garage door opener plugs in.It has a lot of features but here are my favorites.- No direct wiring. Simply plug it in a configure. (They sell direct wire and even battery versions as well)- The spotlight sensitivity and area detection are both adjustable so I can set it to only turn on the light when you are half way up the driveway. However, it will start recording when a person is walking on the sidewalk on my side of the street or even across the street.- I set it so it will only record when a person is detected. It will not record when a car drives by. It can be set either this was just a personal preference.- The light intensity is adjustable as well. I have it set to Max and it is blinding.- The night vision is excellent.- Two really cool features: - I can click a button in the smartphone app and speak to my phone and the audio comes out of the camera speaker allowing you to talk to some on the driveway. The microphone on the camera allows the person to talk back. During a recording session the camera records audio. Crystal clear audio even 60 or more feet away. Some neighborhood kids were arguing about cleaning up dog poop on my lawn the other day and I could hear every word and that was 60 feet away. (They cleaned it up) - There is also a button on the app to turn on an audible alarm. The motion sensor will flash red when you do this.- The install is extremely easy and even with drilling that hole took a total of 15 minutes.A lot more can be configured but these are the main items that I use.The reason I gave it four instead of five stars is the zoom functionality. When you zoom in it gets more and more pixelated as you get closer. I do have friends that have other brands and admittedly they do the same thing. Hopefully this gets better in the future.All in all I really like the security they provide. I can wake up in the morning and see all the activity that occurred at night to ensure that nobody was near my house, or I can be alerted in real time during the night if there is activity.5 Stars for ease of install5 Stars for quality and features4 Stars for Zoom in picture quality",,,,,,,,,,,,,"[3706, 234, 5248, 7801, 6401, 2270, 5774, 994, 7801, 8583, 4851, 3159, 3981, 6067, 5118, 7801, 7801, 2270, 1043, 1074, 6665, 8658, 3706, 5307, 4851, 1091, 448, 8587, 3488, 3409, 6061, 5071, 5083, 5409, 1222, 1091, 2273, 448, 4961, 7062, 7856, 1046, 4465, 6706, 3024, 6518, 278, 6664, 278, 7801, 4292, 3981, 3, 3265, 2088, 8655, 3996, 8134, 4813, 7856, 1043, 9, 7801, 3159, 2269, 448, 271, 284, 7796, 3478, 3, 3113, 8451, 5083, 4851, 1091, 278, 213, 7801, 8583, 64, 7801, 7801, 8685, 284, 4266, 3981, 2623, 278, 6866, 3, 4414, 5083, 6026, 3706, 1259, 7801, 8729, 8426, 6916, 3706, 3488, 271, 5214, 8740, 7801, 2220, 5083, 7801, 5849, 5692, 8728, 278, 6915, 2329, 3, 3605, 448, 7801, 7224, 278, 5988, 7801, 1645, 7879, 7801, 8515, 7801, 4119, 1427, 8739, 8728, 1293, 7796, 1059, 605, 4861, 3773, 2596, 2807, 5167, 7062, 278, 3996, 4495, 3996, 4392, 4303, 3, 5796, 3706, 7816, 5586, 3996, 3946, 7801, 5214, 5118, 7801, 1152, 8658, 7801, 3159, 2269, 5136, 5589, 3478, 3, 4414, 5083, 2790, 994, 3544, 376, 4851, 4972, 2143, 6915, 5585, 3996, 3773, 3, 6695, 2143, 8728, 278, 2588, 598, 8427, 409, 7801, 7225, 6712, 278, 377, 2077, 376, 814, 114, 7062, 3706, 1059, 6744, 3996, 7944, 5130, 8131, 5118, 7801, 4292, 8655, 8870, 376, 3416, 8583, 8290, 7801, 3996, 8703, 7328, 6090, 8655, 3, 5441, 3981, 8511, 5118, 7801, 6883, 5118, 4851, 6879, 5083, 7801, 7438, 5167, 2588, 64, 7801, 3706, 6744, 3996, 7062, 3996, 8703, 5130, 6087, 8655, 3, 5441, 3981, 3996, 8703, 4994, 6087, 8655, 3, 1091, 2340, 3996, 1059, 605, 6744, 2442, 7856, 8541, 4081, 3, 5442, 7801, 4292, 3920, 3981, 114, 409, 3706, 3488, 3996, 6744, 7944, 4576, 278, 3996, 3981, 7801, 4961, 8470, 3981, 8151, 6032, 1631, 3706, 1059, 1330, 3, 1001, 3773, 7801, 7022, 330, 278, 7157, 7944, 4851, 5465, 278, 7801, 475, 1427, 5204, 5083, 7801, 1046, 7158, 224, 8870, 7944, 7680, 7944, 7105, 5118, 7801, 7801, 4656, 5118, 7801, 1046, 225, 7801, 5441, 7944, 7680, 2376, 3, 6090, 6743, 7801, 1046, 6092, 1796, 1321, 475, 2588, 5167, 4788, 2807, 7105, 4920, 4108, 8639, 383, 8, 1314, 8290, 2254, 5640, 5118, 4851, 4215, 7801, 5197, 1885, 278, 3706, 1677, 3508, 2596, 8774, 278, 7796, 8541, 2807, 1312, 3996, 7819, 3981, 236, 3, 1001, 5118, 7801, 330, 7944, 8131, 5118, 271, 474, 7801, 4805, 6713, 8703, 2919, 6101, 8655, 8870, 2245, 7801, 3878, 3981, 2705, 2407, 278, 2588, 8739, 2330, 7796, 3605, 7977, 3, 7998, 5083, 4414, 4788, 1059, 605, 1532, 994, 7828, 376, 7801, 4480, 4000, 7796, 3706, 6037, 3706, 3183, 3996, 3060, 3894, 5083, 2899, 7327, 3981, 7801, 8899, 8655, 8870, 8899, 3773, 3996, 3208, 4788, 278, 4788, 5528, 409, 8870, 3207, 3706, 2245, 3488, 3092, 7796, 3488, 5197, 870, 278, 124, 7831, 2245, 7801, 6531, 3637, 7856, 3208, 684, 3773, 7801, 3773, 213, 3706, 6032, 4303, 7801, 6664, 7831, 3706, 1059, 8503, 8290, 3773, 7801, 4791, 278, 6665, 213, 7801, 77, 7796, 5069, 448, 4961, 7944, 2526, 7796, 4974, 8541, 4891, 4851, 5167, 3706, 1059, 605, 203, 3773, 6026, 7918, 2376, 7801, 4961, 3723, 7819, 3981, 7327, 3024, 2399, 5083, 7327, 3024, 5930, 278, 7327, 3024, 8899, 3773, 5487, 5930]"

The outlet is usually used under a lectern, and a narrow dc power supply fits nicely for a light (though the cover won't close with it plugged in). The closing cover does work well and stays shut when standard cords are used. The main reason we went with this model was its use of a decora style outlet. As I mentioned, we were replacing an older outlet that was a standard outlet within 2 feet of a baptistry pool. It was very easy to change out the outlet that this cover came with to a GFCI outlet to make it safer for floor use.The only downside I had was because both the outlet box and the cover need to fit into the hole, there is almost no play on the measurements if you are off.

1828,1828,"The Expert Gardener Industrial Nozzle, is a great basic sprayer to connect to your garden hose. It is made of hard plastic, and feels very solid. I have already dropped it on the concrete, and not a scratch on it, after it bounced around. The parts that connect to the hoses are metal, which makes them even more durable. The sprayer design allows you to decide what type of spray to use, by just squeezing the lever differently, from a very light fan type of spray for watering delicate flowers, to a powerful spray, that shoots about 25 feet, for things like washing your car. The grip has a notch for your index finger, which helps it stay in your hand, even when wet. There is also a metal flip piece, that allows you to set the spray level, and not have to continuously squeeze the handle to keep it spraying. The other cool design thing, is the screw piece on the end of the nozzle, so you can attach another hose to it, or attach those weed and feed spray attachments to it, to give more power and control over the water flow, when using those types of things. If you are looking for a basic sprayer, but want a few extra bells and whistles, I highly recommend the Expert Gardener Industrial Nozzle.See more",,,,,,,,,,,,,"[7801, 2680, 3167, 3831, 3981, 3, 3315, 583, 7234, 7944, 1542, 7944, 8874, 3164, 3996, 3981, 4465, 5083, 3464, 278, 2805, 8432, 3706, 3488, 234, 2346, 3996, 5118, 7801, 278, 4994, 3, 6601, 5118, 159, 3996, 834, 7801, 5322, 7796, 1542, 7944, 7801, 3652, 376, 8663, 4495, 7809, 2588, 4788, 7801, 7234, 2043, 225, 8870, 7944, 1913, 8646, 8154, 5083, 7231, 7944, 1013, 4081, 7280, 7801, 4277, 3097, 3, 8432, 4292, 2757, 8154, 5083, 7231, 3024, 8569, 1982, 7944, 3, 5694, 7796, 6837, 8, 3024, 7845, 4303, 8548, 8874, 7801, 3334, 3478, 3, 4995, 3024, 8874, 3814, 8663, 3538, 3996, 7344, 3773, 8874, 2588, 8655, 7819, 3981, 236, 3, 4640, 2951, 7796, 225, 8870, 7944, 6744, 7801, 7231, 278, 4994, 3488, 7944, 1599, 7277, 7801, 3440, 7944, 4087, 3996, 7801, 5197, 1631, 2043, 3981, 7801, 6613, 5491, 5118, 7801, 2502, 5083, 7801, 7062, 8870, 1059, 453, 297, 3650, 7944, 5167, 453, 7860, 8608, 278, 2796, 7231, 459, 7944, 7944, 3225, 4788, 5692, 278, 1609, 5227, 7801, 8566, 8655, 8351, 7860, 8156, 5083, 3723, 8870, 376, 4394, 3024, 3, 583, 994, 8522, 3, 2819, 2703, 662, 278, 3706, 3567, 6078, 7801, 2680, 3167, 3831, 4788]"

This nozzle is a smaller sized nozzle than I had expected and it seems to be a lighter weight metal, which I'm afraid won't last past one summer. This nozzle would be appropriate for gardening and yard use for sure. The water stream can be adjusted by using the gold colored screw on the back side of the nozzle. Even though you can adjust it, it's really not really accurate on the adjusting part. You can shoot a full powered stream of water or make it a spread out shower pattern but that's about it. This nozzle is good when you clean out horse trailers or when you wash pickups and it works good to spray the under side of a muddy pickup too.

The impact I noticed was that the sound of the water being sent side to side by the little thing in the nozzle made the sound of the impact hammer or drill. But thats it. The stream is useful for moving dirt or leaf clumps out of a corner or tough spot for angling the hose as the pulses will be enough to slide it slowly in the direction of the water spray.

When I went into the attic, I found that the previous brace was between two joists and not mounted onto a joist.  I thought I was going to need to buy a 2x4 and cut it into the exact size to make a sturdy enough beam to install a ceiling fan brace until I came across this life saver.  This ceiling fan brace was super easy to use, placed it above the hole of the ceiling fan location, and twisted the bar as the 2 sides extended.  Once extended enough, both ends have claws that dig into the joists. This product was a life saver, simple, cheap, and very easy to install.

2177,2177,"The Expert Gardener brand telescoping wand is the perfect accessory to have if you wash your vehicle yourself instead of going to a car wash, which is the primary reason I got it. The main advantages to using this wand when washing a car is the ability to control the water flow to a very very low rate, along with an adjustable water pattern spray. When rinsing the car with the very low water flow spray, with the pattern set to a wide setting, it really helps to prevent water spots on the car as compared to using a regular water hose with sprayer attachment. The telescoping action of the wand also allows you to direct the rinse water where you want it to go on top of the car without straining to reach those areas.In my experience, and this is with the hard water in Phoenix AZ, the water spots are almost eliminated on the vertical areas (the sides, the doors, etc) of the car after rinsing. Horizontal areas such as the hood and the top still need some towel drying though (I think you would need a mineral free water to help with that).The adjustable water flow is easily controlled with your thumb on the handle area of the wand. From zero flow to full pressure flow. Its a lever that is moved instead of a squeeze type control, so you can set it and not have to constantly hold it to maintain a desired pressure/flow.

2296,2296,"This is probably as good a plier type pex cutting tool as you going to findâ€”very sturdy (all metal) and well made. That said, it suffers from the same deficiency that all of these tool designs doâ€”it takes some degree of skill to achieve a perfect right angle cut when it should not have to. Firstly, when you lay the pex run atop the cradle or bottom jaw of the tool, you are placing it on a smooth open sweeping surface that really offers no buttressing or guide positioning. So you must hold the length of pex perfectly still at a precise right angle against the cradle surface. Secondly, as you squeeze the handles and the blade begins to bite down on top of the tubing, the tool begins to try to pull the pex at an oblique angle, potentially jeopardizing the integrity of the cut. After a few practice tries, I was able to achieve a fairly decent square cutâ€”not perfect, but close. This tool could greatly be improved with the addition of some type of half pipe channel guideâ€”perhaps an inch or so long that was the same as the O.D. of the pex and attached to either side of the bottom jaw at right angles. That way, you could feed the tubing into the channel where it would be held in place. When you then squeezed the jaws, the tubing would be held fast, and would have no ability to wiggle or shift position, thereby yielding a perfect and precise right angle cut every time with no possibility of error. This, in my opinion would be a tremendous improvement to this type of tool with minimal redesigning.

So, I did order new, but when I took it out it was toi old to reuse, so I recommend just buying new spline. Otherwise,you may just end up running up to the local hardware store while in the middle of the project & hoping they have the size & color in stock. Screen seems solid and looks like it'll hold up. Shipping was quick and I would definitely buy from this seller again. Just make sure to measure 2x. The product I bought was actually ""bug screen"" the same as what is in all my windows, but these darn small gnats can still get through.

The metal type is his favorite as it holds up to being dropped and holds up better in the weather. We live in a dry part of Texas and growing grass is extremely challenging. He likes being able to stand on the porch and have a nozzle that will spray across the front yard. He prefers to water the grass using a nozzle because I have lots of bird feeders which do not need to get wet. The nozzle is easy for him to control and adjust to the stream he needs. He also washes his truck once a week. The powerful stream comes in handy during the seasonal love bugs. It also has threads on the end of the nozzle so he can attach his power wand.

But if you're looking for a clamp to hold pieces securely in place while you drill / counter sink / screw, etc. these work great.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"[639, 6523, 7796, 8870, 1059, 4942, 3488, 7976, 4532, 1293, 278, 3706, 8813, 173, 8739, 8870, 236, 4906, 7944, 3488, 7801, 6397, 3706, 6565, 3670, 8628, 7828, 8703, 8776, 3723, 8870, 4906, 3, 4414, 5083, 1292, 5737, 626, 3706, 8330, 7809, 409, 271, 2703, 6744, 5083, 3444, 7944, 3600, 7845, 7950, 2376, 423, 4802, 8739, 8764, 3552, 561, 1293, 8739, 6613, 120, 8776, 3315, 3024, 4801, 3244, 8308, 278, 3024, 7860, 6032, 3562, 5737, 6935, 3706, 8330, 5510, 994, 3723, 4394, 3024, 3, 1289, 7944, 3600, 5492, 6661, 3773, 5530, 8665, 8870, 2328, 1681, 6920, 7828, 8776]"
